# Google Form Scammer

This is a simple C# code to submit multiple responses to Google Form automatically.


The program was originally written from thoughts of scamming the survey and getting the highest score of participation marks when UBC E-Week got moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was not actually implemented since this behaviour violates the moral standards. But this idea helped me create a code to submit multiple responses very easily when needed. 

This includes four functionalities:
- Choosing a random answer for multiple choice questions
- Name Generator (Both first and last name)
- 14-digit Barcode Generator
- Submitting fixed/desired answers

If the barcode and name data were given, it could have been connected to the database. So the next step of this project would be combined with database management, which can be expanded to getting the associated name with a valid barcode.
