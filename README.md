# Google Form Scammer

This is a simple C# code to submit multiple responses to Google Form automatically.
The program was originally written from thoughts of scamming the survey and getting the highest score of participation marks when UBC E-Week got moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was not actually implemented since this behaviour violates the moral standards. But this idea helped me create a code to submit multiple responses very easily when needed.
